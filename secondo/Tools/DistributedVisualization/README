Distributed Visualization Installation Instructions
===================================================

(1) On the computer hosting the master of the Distributed2Algebra, install the tools node.js + npm (see https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Using Ubuntu
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

One can check successful installation with

ralf@newton1:~$ node -v
v10.16.2
ralf@newton1:~$ npm -v
6.9.0

(2) In the secondo directory, run

make DistributedVisualization

(3) Create a directory

secondo/bin/distributed_logs

(4) Set directory for distributed logs

In the file

secondo/Tools/DistributedVisualization/server/config/development.json

edit the line

	"log_location_absolute": "/home/ralf/secondo/bin/distributed_logs

to the path of your distributed_logs directory.


(5) Set host IP address and port for server

In the same file development.json

edit the line

        "http_port": 3000,

and set the port to a desired port number exclusively available for this server. This is the server side.


(6) Set host IP address and port for client

In the directory secondo/Tools/DistributedVisualization/client/src/config 

edit the file 

default.ts

In the line  

	base_url: "http://localhost:3000"

set IP address and port of the host. This is the client side. Must be the same port as for the server.







Starting the Visualization
==========================

(1) Start the visualization server:

In directory /secondo/Tools/DistributedVisualization/server

npm run start

(2) In a web browser, goto

http://<server IP>:<port>

for example

http://132.176.69.45:3000

It should work once a distributed query has been run.
