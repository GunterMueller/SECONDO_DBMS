First install ant.

-------------------------------------------
For example you can do it in this way:


Make sure you have a Java environment installed

Enter the URL: http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi.

On the Apache Ant Project page, find the heading Current Release of Ant. 

Save and extract the package file into a Linux home directory.

Set the ANT_OPTS environment variable:
export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx256M"

Set the ANT_HOME environment variable to the directory where you installed Ant:
export ANT_HOME={ant_dir}

Set the PATH environment variable to include the directory where you installed the Ant bin directory:
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANT_HOME}/bin



From the ANT_HOME directory run 

ant -f fetch.xml -Ddest=system 

------------------------------------------------


Then build the project with the following command


ant -Dplatforms.Java_HotSpot_TM__Client_VM_1.4.2_13-b06.home=/home/userxy/jdk1.8.0_112 jar


Here "/home/userxy/jdk1.8.0_112" is an example of the path to your jdk home folder.
Adjust this path accordingly.

You will find the MCInterpolator.jar file in the dist subfolder of this directory.
