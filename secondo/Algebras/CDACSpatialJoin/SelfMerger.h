2 SelfMerger class

This class is used within a self join to merge two adjacent SelfMergedArea
instances into a new SelfMergedArea. The process is interrupted whenever the
output TBlock is full and can be resumed by calling merge() again.

To keep terminology clear,

  * 1 / 2 always refers to the two areas 1 / 2 to be merged
    (area 1 being the left neighbor of area 2);

  * left / right (or L / R) always refers to the left / right edge of a
    single rectangle;

  * S / T is used for two different JoinEdge vectors in reportPairsSub():

    * regarding areas, either (S=1 and T=2) or (S=2 and T=1);

    * regarding edges, either (S=left and T=right) or (S=right and T=left);
