1 CacheTest operator

This operator performs a cache test of the given intensity (use
intensity = 128 or higher for meaningful test results) by creating a large
array of integer values and repeatedly performing first sequential access,
then random access to various scopes of this array.

Different scope sizes are tested, starting from 1 KiB scope size (which easily
fits into the L1 Data Cache, making repeated access to such a scope very fast),
then doubling scope size until L1, L2, and L3 cache sizes are exceeded. The
final scope size is at least 8 times higher than the size of the largest cache
(e.g., for an 8 MiB L3 cache, the final scope size is 64 MiB, and access is
significantly slower than access with 1 KiB scope size - e.g. 2 times slower
for sequential access, and 40 times slower for random access).

The test results for each scope size are reported to the console. In between
tests, all caches are overwritten with other data. Test results are given in
milliseconds (ms) per 1 billion read access operations, depending on scope size
and access type (sequential / random). These results are obtained by

  1 performing a test with array access ("gross" duration),

  2 performing the same test without array access (but with the same loops
    and, if applicable, random number generation as used in the first test),
    and then

  3 calculating the "net" duration as the difference between 1 and 2. To
    reduce deviation, this process is performed 3 times and the average
    duration is used as a result.

The total execution time of the test is approx. "a few seconds
(e.g. 3 seconds) * intensity", obviously depending on the machine.
