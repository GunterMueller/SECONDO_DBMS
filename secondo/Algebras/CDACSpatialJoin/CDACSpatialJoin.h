1 CDACSpatialJoin operator

The ~cdacspatialjoin~ operator performs a cache-oriented spatial join on
two streams of tuples or tuple blocks, using a divide-and-conquer strategy.

As arguments, ~cdacspatialjoin~ expects two streams of tuples or tuple blocks.
Optionally, the name of the join attributes for each argument relation can be
specified. If these attribute names are omitted, the first attribute with a
suitable spatial kind is used. The operator returns a stream of tuple blocks.

The algorithm is based on Ralf Hartmut Gueting, Werner Schilling: A
practical divide-and-conquer algorithm for the rectangle intersection problem.
Inf. Sci. 42(2): 95-112 (1987). While this paper describes the self join case,
CDACSpatialJoin reports intersecting rectangles from two different rectangle
sets (streams) A and B.

/*
2 CDACSpatialJoinCount operator

The ~CDACSpatialJoinCount~ operator specializes the CDACSpatialJoin operator
for cases in which only the number of result tuples is required, but not the
result tuples themselves.

For ~CDACSpatialJoinCount~, only the bounding boxes of the respective join
attributes need to be kept in memory (for which purpose the RectangleBlock
class is being used), while all other tuple data can be discarded from memory,
allowing for JoinStates to treat rectangle sets of significantly higher
cardinality. Furthermore, the ~CDACSpatialJoinCount~ operator does not
implicitly convert input streams of tuples into tuple blocks (as the
~CDACSpatialJoin~ operator would) and, obviously, does not combine intersecting
tuples to create result tuples.

The four arguments of ~CDACSpatialJoinCount~ match the first four arguments of
the ~CDACSpatialJoin~ operator (i.e. two streams of tuples or tuple blocks and,
optionally, the names of the join attributes). The operator returns the number
of intersections, i.e. the number of tuples that a ~CDACSpatialJoin~ call with
the same arguments would return.
