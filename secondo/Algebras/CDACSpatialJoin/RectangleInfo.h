1 RectangleInfo struct

Represents a 2-dimensional rectangle (i.e. a 2-dimensional bounding box or the
2-dimensional projection of a 3-dimensional bounding box) extracted from
spatial data. The y coordinates are stored as double values, while for the
x coordinates, only the relative position in the sort order given by
SortEdge::compare is needed (thereby saving 2 * 4 bytes per rectangle).

This struct is used by the JoinState constructor to temporarily store rectangle
information (yMin, yMax, address), then add information from the sort result
(left/rightEdgeIndex), and finally construct JoinEdge instances.
