1 Timer class

This class provides measurement of runtime and cache misses for a given number
of tasks. Measurement for a given tasks may me started and stopped many times;
in this case, the number of calls, the sum (of runtime and cache misses), and
the average can be retrieved.

Measurement of cache misses requires the Performance API (PAPI) to be installed
and TIMER\_USES\_PAPI to be defined (see below).


1.1 Using Timer for other operators

Timer can easily be used to analyse any other operator as well:

  * add a Timer field in the LocalInfo class:

----
    #include "Algebras/CDACSpatialJoin/Timer.h"
    class ... {
    private:
    std::shared_ptr<cdacspatialjoin::Timer> timer;
----

  * initialize "timer(nullptr)" in the LocalInfo constructor, then configure
    it within the constructor, e.g. with

----
    std::vector<std::string> taskNames;
    taskNames.emplace_back("createLocalInfo"); // task 0
    taskNames.emplace_back("requestData");     // task 1
    taskNames.emplace_back("nextTBlock");      // task 2
    taskNames.emplace_back("destructor");      // task 3
    timer.reset(new cdacspatialjoin::Timer(taskNames));
----

  * at the beginning of each task, tell the timer which task is starting now,
    using its taskNames index, e.g.

----
    timer->start(0); // start task 0 "createLocalInfo"
----

  * you may switch between tasks multiple times. Starting a task automatically
    finishes the previous task.

  * at the end of the LocalInfo destructor, to make Timer report the result
    to the standard output add

----
    timer->stop();
    timer->reportTable(std::cout, true, true, false, false, false);
----

1.3 Performance API (PAPI) usage

If TIMER\_USES\_PAPI is defined, the Performance API (PAPI) will be
used in the Timer class to count and report cache misses. To use PAPI,

  * download and extract PAPI from https://icl.utk.edu/papi

  * follow INSTALL.txt to compile ('make'), test ('make fulltest') and
    install ('sudo make install-all') PAPI;

  * in secondo/makefile.algebras, e.g. below the line 'ALGEBRAS +=
    CDACSpatialJoinAlgebra', add the line

---- ALGEBRA_LINK_FLAGS += -L/usr/local/lib64 -lpapi
----

  * in the (hidden) file .bashrc in the home directory, add

----  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib64
----

  * restart the computer and recompile SECONDO with TIMER\_USES\_PAPI
    defined.
