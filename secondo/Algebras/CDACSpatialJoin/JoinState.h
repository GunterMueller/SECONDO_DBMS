3 JoinState class

At initialization, the JoinState class expects data from both input streams.
Its public method nextTBlock() then fills the given outTBlock with result
tuples until either the outTBlock is full, or the operation is complete.
Result tuples are combined from one tuple of each input stream respectively,
where the bounding box of these tuples' GeoData intersect.

If "countOnly == true" is passed in the constructor, intersections are merely
counted, but no output tuples are written to the outTBlock. The result count
can then be retrieved using the getOutTupleCount() getter.

JoinState detects self joins (if the bounding boxes of both inputs are exactly
identical, including the same TBlock positions) and treats this special case
efficiently using specialized methods and classes (SelfMergedArea, SelfMerger).
