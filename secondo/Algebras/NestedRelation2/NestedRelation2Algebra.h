[1] NestedRelation2 Algebra
2016-2017, Thomas Peredery

[toc]

1 Preamble

The documentation to this algebra is build by concatenating all source files
before using the PD system. This can be done by the "make_pd.sh"[2] or
"make_pd.bat"[2] script.

1 Overview

The NestedRelation2 algebra is an algebra for the extensible database
management system SECONDO, which is maintained by the University of Hagen. It
offers type constructors and operators to work with nested relations. Their
usage equals those of the older NestedRelation algebra, but the storage system
underlying the newer algebra is no longer based on separate relations, but on
so called "Faked Large OBjects"[9] (FLOBs) managed by SECONDO. The import of the
DBLP literature database of the university of Trier is no longer a Java program
but an operator of the algebra.

1 Structure

The types and operators made available in Secondo are implemented in their own
classes each. The main classes and the files they are in are named after the
operator or datatype they are implementing. For example the type "arel"[2] is
implemented by the class "ARel"[2] in "ARel.h"[2] and "ARel.cpp"[2]. The
operator "dblpimport"[2] is implemented by several classes. Its main class is
"DblpImport"[2] defined in "DblpImport.h"[2] and "DblpImport.cpp"[2].

To avoid name clashes each of these classes is defined in a namespace named
"nr2a"[2].

1 Preliminaries

The algebra depends on the following other algebras:

  * Relation algebra (NRel stores data of top level in a relation internally)

  * Stream algebra

  * FText algebra

The DBLP import uses libxml which is assumed to be installed and configured
properly on the system running SECONDO.

To simplify the management of the header files in each header file special
defines are used to avoid multiple includes of declarations.

/*
The "AutoWrite()"[2] macro is used for debugging any expressions, especially
nested lists. It outputs several information:

  * The expression, which is evaluated, as it is written in the code

  * The file, line number and function name where the macro is called

  * The evaluated value

[3] AutoWrite(3+2);

will output:

[4] "a+b"[9] in "int Sum(int a, int b)"[9] (Line "32"[9] of "Calc.cpp"[9])
5

assuming "a==3"[2] and "b==2"[2]

The precompiler switch "DOAUTOWRITE"[2] is used to change the behavior of the
macro and avoid its output. This prevents slowing down processing and reduces
noisy output. Notice, that the expression itself is still evaluated and any side
effects occur, too. This feature avoids unexpected behavior if the macro
is used like:

[3] AutoWrite(b++);

It is possible to wrap it into another construct to avoid its execution.

[3] #ifdef DO_COMPLEX_CHECKS
AutoWrite(largeObject.ComplexCalculation());
#endif

Accordingly "WriteFlob"[2] can be used to output a "Flob"[2]s content. It takes
the "offset"[2] where to start and the maximum "size"[2] to output.

/*
To iterate nested lists the "listForeach"[2] macro is implemented. Given a
nested list to iterate and an name for a variable to use as reference to the
element of the current iteration. An example for its usage is:

[3] listForeach(typeList, current)
cout << nl->StringValue(current).cstr() << endl;
