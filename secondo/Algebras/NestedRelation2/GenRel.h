The operator "genRel"[2] is used to generate nested relations of several forms
for testing. It features the possibility to build relations of types
"nrel2"[2] and "arel2"[2], "nrel"[2] and "arel"[2] as well as "record"[2] and
"vector"[2]. It is possible to nest them to arbitrary depth.

Relations can contain a specifiable amount of attributes of different atomic
types and can grow to an arbitrary length given. For attributes of types
"string"[2] and "text"[2] the length is definable. Furthermore the selectivity
can be adjusted to support the testing of filter conditions.
