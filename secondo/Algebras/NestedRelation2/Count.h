1 Operators

In this documentation the operators are sorted by ``complexity'' in ascending
order. First there are some more simple operators, afterwards the ones dealing
with streams and at last the ones implemented for testing and/or debugging.

1.1 Count

This implementation of "count"[2] can be used in conjunction with "ARel"[2] and
"NRel"[2] values an returns their amount of tuples on the top level. An
implementation for streams thereof is provided by the Stream algebra.
