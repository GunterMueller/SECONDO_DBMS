1.1 \textit{CommunicationServer}

The \textit{CommunicationServer} is the counterpart of the
\textit{CommunicationClient}. Whenever communication associated with the
 \textit{DBService's} functionality takes place,
 the \textit{CommunicationServer} is contacted by a
 \textit{CommunicationClient}.
 The \textit{CommunicationServer} is deducted from the more generic class
 \textit{Server} of the \textit{Distributed2Algebra} which had to be extracted
 from the \textit{FileTransferServer} for this purpose. The second superclass
 of the \textit{CommunicationServer} is \textit{MultiClientServer}, as we only
 want to have one \textit{CommunicationServer} per node which is able to handle
 multiple client requests.
