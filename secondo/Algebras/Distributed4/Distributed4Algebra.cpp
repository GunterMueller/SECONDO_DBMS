[10] Algebra Distributed4

2017-10-31: Sebastian J. Bronner $<$sebastian@bronner.name$>$

The type constructors and operators of this algebra are assigned to the algebra
in this file. However, they are implemented in other files as follows:

  * Types in corresponding class files ("TypeName.cpp"[1] and
    "TypeName.h)"[1])

  * Operators in "Operators.cpp"[1] and "Operators.h"[1]

"Distributed4Algebra"[1] is derived from "Algebra"[1], just like every other
algebra here. The default constructor is redefined to add this algebra's types
and operators.

It is not possible simply to create an instance of the class "Algebra"[1] and
add the type constructors and operators to that object because the member
functions "AddTypeConstructor"[1] and "AddOperator"[1] are "protected"[1] in
"Algebra"[1].

/*
Add Operators

The "Operator"[1] class takes care of putting together operator instances given
values and functions for an operator. The constructor expects the following
elements: name of operator, specification of operator, value mapping function
(for overloaded operators, the number of available value mapping functions and
an array of those functions are supplied instead), selection function (simple
operators use "Operator::SimpleSelect"[1]), type mapping function.

The "OperatorSpec"[1] class formats human-readable specification for the
operators in a consistent way. The constructor expects four or five strings in
the following order: signature, syntax, meaning, example, remark (optional).
