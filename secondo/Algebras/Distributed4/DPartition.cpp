5 Modifying Member Functions

5.1 "allocateSlot"[1]

There are several different occasions when a new or recycled slot in a

aren't being used. This can happen as the result of ~moveslot~ and ~mergeslots~
when the unused slot is numerically in between other slots in the ~d[f]array~.

This function won't directly modify the referenced ~d[f]array~ database object.
Instead, it will modify an in-memory instance of that object. A pointer to this
instance is passed as "da"[1].

The procedure for allocating a new slot mirrors the complexity mentioned above:
