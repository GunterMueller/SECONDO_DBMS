2 Constructors

2.1 "ManagedMutex"[1] (locking constructor)

This constructor takes the "name"[1] of an object and whether it is to be
locked for "exclusive"[1] access, or not as parameters. An additional optional
argument specifies if the function is to "wait"[1] until a lock can be acquired
or abort if no lock can be acquired immediately. The default is to wait ("wait
== true"[1]). That passed "name"[1] is used as a basis for the name of the
underlying named sharable mutex and its shared memory (SHM) segment.

Make sure "name"[1] refers to a real database object.

*/

      throw runtime_error{"The object \"" + name + "\" couldn't be locked "
        "because it doesn't exist."};
/*
A race condition exists where it is possible for this process to map the SHM
segment and another process to remove that SHM segment. This happens when the
other process checked for mapped references before the SHM segment was mapped
in this process and subsequently removed it. This race condition is mitigated
here. After mapping the shared memory segment, the mutex is locked and a check
is performed to see if the mapping is still valid. If it isn't, the race
condition happened, and the mutex is re-mapped. This is repeated as often as
necessary for the mapping to remain valid after the mutex is locked.

2.2 "ManagedMutex"[1] (takeover constructor)

for it (take over ownership). If the mutex is found not to be locked, it will
abort.

reference exists. In the absence of a mapped reference, the shared memory

4 Member Functions

4.1 "noautounlock"[1]

By default, the "ManagedMutex"[1] will be automatically released when the mutex
object is destroyed. This helps to avoid stuck locks after exceptions. As this
is not always the desired behavior, it can be prevented by calling this
function.

*/
  void ManagedMutex::noautounlock() {
    autounlock = false;
  }
/*
4.2 "lock"[1]

Unlike other mutex implementations that offer ~seperate member functions~ for
exclusive and sharable locking, "lock"[1] takes an ~argument~ indicating the
desired lock type: "true"[1] for an exclusive lock or "false"[1] for a sharable
lock. An additional optional argument specifies if the function is to "wait"[1]
until a lock can be acquired or abort if no lock can be acquired immediately.
The default is to wait ("wait == true"[1]). If a process tries to lock a mutex
more than once, a "runtime\_error"[1] exception is thrown.

/*
4.3 "unlock"[1]

The state of the lock is tracked. Therefore, it is not necessary to distinguish
between unlocking a sharable lock and an exclusive one when calling
"unlock()"[1]. There is just this one member function to unlock both lock
types. If a process tries to unlock a mutex that is not locked, a
"runtime\_error"[1] exception is thrown.

4.4 "getSHMPath"[1]

This member function is for internal use only. Its primary purpose is to allow
assigning a value to shm\_target in the initializer list of the constructor.
